# Study Block 1

## Week 1


Overall the challenge I faced was trying to work effectively
as a team with a group of people I didn’t know very well to complete the Lego
challenges, this however became easier throughout the week as I had more time
to spend with each person and we spent time getting to know each other better
allowing us to work more effectively as a team. Another challenge I faced was
that while programming one of the challenges it was hard to gauge how many
rotations the robot should be turning to get it to the exact position it needed
to be, to overcome this I did multiple tests to make sure it was in the right
position.


## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to use the git
hub program as it is not something that I have ever used before so there was a
bit of a learning curve in how to fork a repository and then upload work to the
forked repository and then creating a pull request however to overcome this
challenge I used the internet to look up how to use the software so that that I
could correctly upload my work to the correct git hub repository and what all
of the different terms used in the git hub software.


## Week 3


I feel like I have progressed over the past two weeks as I am getting a better
grasp on the different modules and how they link together with each other. One
challenge I faced throughout the week was writing the pseudocode for the
fallout 4 mini-game in a way that anyone who would read the code would
understand, to overcome this I compared different examples of pseudocode from
different places to try and make it readable universally. Another challenge I
faced was when creating the paper prototype for the Bull game trying to
represent it in a way that would be true to how it would be on screen, to
overcome this we worked as a team to try out different ways we could present
the information.


## Week 4


One challenge that I faced was when I was designing the
concept for the video game was trying to create something original that could
be targeted at an already existing target audience while still making the game
easy to make with an interesting premise, to overcome this I took inspiration
from other video games to help shape what the gameplay and story would be and
how different elements such as the music and the art style would change the
look and feel of the game. It was also then turning those ideas into visual
representations and describing them in a pitch.


## Week 5


Some of the challenges that I faced throughout the week was fully understanding the
big O notation with quadratic complexity and having the ability to present my
ideas in a professional manor as to make my game concept marketable to a set of
people who potentially would not be a part of my target audience. To overcome
these challenges, I changed the visual aesthetic of my work to make it look more
approachable and understandable to the target audience making sure that the
aesthetic was consistent all the way through to make it look more like an
industry standard piece of work.


## Week 6


N/A: At Duke of Edenborough Expedition


## Week 7


One challenge I faced was trying to understand how memory
allocation through containers worked and how dictionaries can be implemented
into my code to make it more efficient. I also struggled in the tinkering
graphics peer review as I find it difficult to be critical of other people’s
code however this is easy to solve by creating a checklist of things to look
for in the code such as whether it flows efficiently by not letting code repeat
itself and making sure that the code is following the PEP-8 guidelines.


## Week 8


One challenge I found this week was the sprint review as
this was the first proper sprint of a project I had done, we found that we had
added far too much to the sprint backlog meaning that when the sprint had ended
that we still had multiple items in the backlog even though we had done a lot
of work and had made lots of progress, another issue we found was that we didn’t
really have a set goal for the end of the sprint. Both issues can easily be
fixed by deciding on a goal for the end of a sprint and making a realistic
guess of what we will be able to achieve during the next sprint to make it more
effective.


## Week 9


One challenge I found this week was learning the difference
between interpreters, AOT compilers and JIT compilers and comparing them in
terms of the runtime efficiency and the portability of each. However, this was
solved by going over the session slides and doing some extra research on the internet
This helped me get a better understanding of how many different languages use
different methods for different reasons.


## Week 10


One challenge I had this week was trying to transition my knowledge
of python into C++ as this meant I had to start learning a completely new
language to be able to use and program on the Unreal 4 Engine. To overcome this
challenge I looked at different documentation on the basics of C++ to make sure
I have the fundamentals correct before moving on to more complex coding.


## Week 11


One challenge that I faced this week was the audio peer
review as over the past sessions as a team we have not been able to get any of
the algorithms to work. However, we have been trying repeatedly over the week
to try and get different code to work to get different types of sound. To make
this easier we have been going over the session slides and looking at external
documentation to generate new audio.


## Week 12


One challenge I faced this week was the investment pitch as I
feel that it could have gone slightly better as due to the HDMI port not
functioning we could not show our game demo making our pitch quite short and
not as effective as it could have been. This could have been fixed by making
sure that the presentation was slightly longer and that the demo was available
to be used on a new computer, possibly by putting it on a memory stick.

# Study Block 2

## Week 1


One challenge that I faced during the week was trying to get
my code for the hacking minigame functional while keeping it maintainable and
coherent, I found that it was small bits of code stopped the entire program
from working. One way I worked to fix this was using pair programming with
someone else to make sure all of the code was present and correct. This helped
pick up on my small mistakes in the coding. This also saved me time rather than
looking through all of the code multiple times to try and find the specific
issues in the game.

## Week 2


One challenge I faced during the week was trying to create
UML Use-Case diagrams and UML Class diagrams as it is not a language I commonly
use in my work however to rectify this I re-read the tutorial documentation to
make sure I have a better grasp on how the diagrams look and how they
effectively function to describe the design of software. This allowed me to
create UML documentation based off of our game Ragnarök Station. Doing this
made it easier to see how different aspects of the game work and how the work
together to make one complete game.

## Week 3


One challenge that I faced over the past week was learning
how to use getters and setters in terms of access control and how to apply this
to different values that I am currently working with in my game. To fix this I
looked at unreal tutorials to find out how this was done in the Unreal 4
Engine, I then applied this knowledge to different parts in my game such as
setting up a pause menu for the player to use in game. I then attempted to give
this menu the correct functionality that would be expected in a normal video
game.

## Week 4


One challenge that I faced this week was getting my head
around time steps, interpolation and substepping, to fix this I went over the
session slides for the lecture and made sure I knew the difference between the
three and how they all have different uses problems such as how variable time
step will fluctuate and isn’t completely accurate due to floating point
numbers, how interpolation tries to fix jerky movement by rendering in-between
updates and how substepping tries to be the best of both fixed and variable
time steps. I then tried to implement this knowledge into my game project.

## Week 5


One challenge that I faced over the past week was learning
how to read Chen, Crows Foot, and UML notation symbols, this was quite odd for
me as it is a very different way of looking at how different systems work, to
fix this I went over the diagrams on the session slides in the learning space to
make sure that I could differentiate from the different types of notation and
why many different types of people would choose to use the different notations
for vastly different reasons. This is because they can have many different
useful applications in other industries.

## Week 6


One challenge that I faced over the past week was learning
how to set up a UNIX Server, to fix this I went over the different tutorials on
the Amazon Web Service and UNIX commands to be able to download, update, edit,
and create different files. This can be used to store data remotely rather than
having it saved to the device making it more efficient to data to be
transferred to the game allowing for different systems to be more easily put in
place such as a leader board for if you were making a game with competitive
scoring.

## Week 7


One challenge that I faced over the past week was trying to
efficiently use version control through SVN to make changes to my COMP160 game,
there was a problem with how people were accessing the different revisions
meaning the game wouldn’t load properly, to fix this we rolled back the game a
few revisions to a working build and made sure that anyone working on the build
was downloading and uploading the correct files to keep the game stable. This
will ensure that the game will stay functional while being able to be quickly
edited to add or remove features or assets.

## Week 8


One challenge that I found this week was trying to get
different systems within the Unreal Engine 4 to work such as a selection system
and rotational torque of a static object. This is vital to my game so it needed
to be fixed for me to move on. To fix this I spent time in the studio with
Brian and managed to get the issue fixed quickly as the code I had already
produced was sufficient enough, I just needed to apply physics and add the
blueprints to the player controller rather than the individual cubes I was
testing the code on.

## Week 9


One challenge I found this week was implementing realistic sky
box into my COMP140 game as this was required to give it the correct aesthetic
that was put down in the concept, this proved to be difficult as I have never
created a sky box and have never needed to implement one in engine. To fix this
I kept adding more layers until I had 19 to a program called Spacescape to add
more detail to make it look more realistic. I then exported it as a DDS image
and used a tutorial to show me how to change the properties of the file to then
be able to add it as a sky box.

## Week 10


One challenge I found this week was making sure that all my
work was completed to the standard I wanted it to be at, this was difficult as
it meant that for my COMP140 game I needed to use Maya in conjunction with the
Unreal Engine 4 to create a texture that made the middle of the cube
transparent while keeping the outline of the cube. To do this I got assistance
while using Maya to make sure that I got all the sizing and the texturing
correct before importing the texture into the unreal engine and applying it to
the static meshes.

## Week 11


One challenge I found this week was trying to make major
edits to the game website through markdown notation as I have not done this
before making it difficult to effectively change the website to make it look
how I want it too with all the content that I needed to be there. To fix this I
looked closer into markdown notation and kept editing the website to try and
get it as close to how the games aesthetic looks, and including different
things about the game such as promotional art, video, and information about the
story of the game.

## Week 12


One challenge I found this week was trying to explain myself
while trying to describe my work during the COMP130 Viva for the Worksheets and
the Research Journal, this was due to the fact that I potentially needed to
have more relevant papers in my research journal to talk more confidently about
visual impairment in the gaming industry. For the worksheets, it was noted that
I needed to re arrange and comment my code to make it easier to read and follow
to make sure that anybody trying to maintain it would be able to do so quickly
and efficiently.
